## About Me

Hey there! I'm Ryan, and I've been immersed in the world of game development since 2016. I have a passion for exploring new technologies and collaborating with fellow engineers to craft immersive virtual experiences. Over the years, I've had the privilege of working with several studios as a Roblox gameplay programmer & engineer, contributing to the successful launch of titles for various brands and clients. My most notable technical skills are as follows:

- Proficient in Roblox Luau, demonstrating expertise through diverse game projects with 6+ years of experience.
- Experienced in using libraries such as Roact, Knit, and a range of RbxUtil Modules.
- Knowledgeable in usage of third-party SDKâ€™s such as GameAnalytics and PlayFab.
- Plugin creation proficiency from previous work experience *(Eg. CutsceneManager, and WhiteBox Designer)*.
- Competent in tools and programs such as Moonwave, TestEZ, GitHub, Bitbucket, VS Code, Rojo, Confluence, and Jira.

My most notable technical skills are as follows:

- Proficient in Roblox Luau, demonstrating expertise through diverse game projects with 8+ years of experience.
- Skilled in using libraries and frameworks such as Roact, Knit, and a range of Rbx Util modules.
- Knowledgeable in usage of third-party SDKâ€™s such as GameAnalytics and PlayFab.

- Competent in tools and programs such as Moonwave, TestEZ, GitHub, Bitbucket, VS Code, Rojo, Confluence, and Jira.

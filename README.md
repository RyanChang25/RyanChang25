Student learning C# and Luau. Open-source software developer.

About Me
I use GitHub for my projects and sometimes a bit of work. For now, I just develop on Roblox with Luau but I plan to expand into other languages and development platforms. I'm currently experienced in Lua and Python. I plan to learn more languages such as C#, JavaScript, and HTML soon.

## About Me

Hi, I'm Ryan! Over the past decade in game development, Iâ€™ve had the privilege of building immersive experiences on the Roblox platform, collaborating with major IPs such as **Universal Pictures**, **Paramount**, and **DreamWorks** (etc.) primarily as a Gameplay Engineer. Iâ€™m passionate about leveraging new technologies and engaging with industry professionals who are equally dedicated to crafting impactful games. My most notable technical skills include:

- Proficient in Roblox Luau, demonstrating expertise through diverse game projects with 8+ years of experience.
- Skilled in using libraries and frameworks such as Roact, Knit, and a range of Rbx Util modules.
- Knowledgeable in usage of third-party SDKâ€™s such as GameAnalytics and PlayFab.
- Plugin creation proficiency from previous work experience *(Eg. CutsceneManager, and WhiteBox Designer)*.
- Competent in tools and programs such as Moonwave, TestEZ, GitHub, Bitbucket, VS Code, Rojo, Confluence, and Jira.
